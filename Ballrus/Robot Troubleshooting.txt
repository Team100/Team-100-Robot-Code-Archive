Davis Robot Problems/Causes/Solutions:
Nothing moves, still have comms, all DIOs turn green: Digital sidecar broken, check cable or replace
Drives full speed into a wall during auto: encoder unplugged/broken, plug in/replace
Slowly drifts off course during auto: gyro initialized incorrectly/drifting, keep the robot still and power cycle, check cable
Potentiometer value equals zero: unplugged/badly wired, plug in/replace wire
Potentiometer positions change values: potentiometer is loose, tighten set-screw
Camera giving errors (EHOSTDOWN): you are plugged into cRIO directly, go through the wireless router
No comms when tethered: router in wrong mode, change switch to "up" position (AP mode?)
No comms when wireless: router in wrong mode, change switch to "down" position (bridge mode)
Deploying code waits forever for cRIO: problem unknown, power cycle
